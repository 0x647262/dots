# Select how to display key IDs. "none" does not show the key ID at all but
# shows the fingerprint in a separate line. "short" is the traditional
# 8-char-acter key ID. "long" is the more accurate (but less convenient)
# 16-character key ID. Add an "0x" to either to include an "0x" at the
# beginning of the key ID, as in 0x99242560. Note that this option is ignored
# if the option --with-colons is used.
#
# Note: Use 0xlong or long to better protect oneself against keyid collisions!

# If a fingerprint is printed for the primary key, this option forces printing

# Set the list of personal cipher preferences to string. Use gpg --version to

# Use string as a comment string in cleartext signatures and ASCII armored

# length of a single comment below 60 characters to avoid problems with mail
# programs wrapping such lines. Note that comment lines, like all other header

# GnuPG normally checks that the timestamps associated with keys and signatures
